The Travel Booking System is a Java-based application designed to simplify and automate the process of planning, managing, and booking travel arrangements such as flights, hotels, and transportation. The system provides users with an easy-to-use interface to browse available travel options, make reservations, and manage their bookings efficiently.

In the traditional travel booking process, customers often need to visit travel agencies or manually search multiple platforms for flights, hotels, and tour packages. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. The proposed Travel Booking System overcomes these challenges by offering a centralized digital platform that integrates all booking-related activities into one application.
